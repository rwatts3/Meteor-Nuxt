# Meteor-Nuxt
A wicked experiment attempting combining Meteor and Nuxt for highly modern application development with split
responsibilities.

We use Nuxt for it's excellent SSR capabilities with Vue. Something Meteor really can't do very well.
Meteor is used simply for what it does do very well, DDP.

## Installation
```bash
npm install     # Install dependencies for Meteor-Nuxt

npm run setup   # Prepare project for first start.
```

## Usage
```bash
npm start
```
This will start up two servers, Meteor and Nuxt.

Once both servers are running, you can access the app through [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
